ALX School Project: Vagrant
This repository contains the tasks related to the "Vagrant" project for ALX School.

Description
This project aims to introduce you to the concept of Vagrant and virtual machines (VMs) running on your local computer. You will learn about the basics of using Vagrant, explore what a virtual machine is, and understand its significance in development environments. Additionally, you will gain insights into Ubuntu, the "uname" command, and other related concepts.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following topics without the need for external assistance:


Tasks
0. Create and setup your Git and GitHub account
This task involves configuring Git and creating your first GitHub repository.

Configure your basic info (name, email) on your local machine â€“ they will be part of your commits.
On GitHub.com, using the web interface, create a new repository with the following details:
Repository Name: zero_day
Description: This is my first repository as a full-stack engineer
Public Repository: Yes
README, .gitignore, or License: None
On your local computer:

Navigate to your home directory.
Create a directory named "zero_day."
Navigate to the newly created "zero_day" directory.
Initialize Git in this directory and set the remote origin.
Create a file named "README.md" using a command line editor (e.g., Emacs) and write a brief Markdown text introducing this project.
Add the "README.md" file to Git, commit the change with the message "My first commit," and push it to the remote server (origin).
1. Hello Ubuntu
In this task, you will create a directory and a README file and then SSH into your Ubuntu virtual machine to answer a question.

Inside the "zero_day" repository, create a new directory called "0x00-vagrant."
Inside the "0x00-vagrant" directory, add a README.md file.
SSH into your Ubuntu VM.
Run the command "uname" without any options and observe its output.
Create a file in the "0x00-vagrant" directory with the answer to the question. Name the file accordingly.
